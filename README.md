FairML Seminar: The Impossibility of Fairness 

In this seminar,  multiple approaches to algorithmic fairness are discussed. This work focuses on the impossibility theorem, as presented by Kleinberg et al., and similarly discussed by Chouldechova.

In this project, the concept of the impossibility of fairness is demonstrated on a a real-world example: the COMPAS algorithm by Northpoint. This software is utilized in justice systems across the United States to predict the recidivism rate of defendants. The data employed in this work is derived from ProPublica's analysis of the COMPAS algorithm. The findings of their analysis are available here: [ProPublica's Machine Bias Article.](https://www.propublica.org/article/machine-bias-risk-assessments-in-criminal-sentencing) Additionally, their analytical methods are outlined here: [ProPublica's Analysis Methodology.](https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm.)https://www.propublica.org/article/how-we-analyzed-the-compas-recidivism-algorithm.
